     * Closures are self contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code.
     Closures in swift are similar to blocks in C and objective-C
     
     Global and nested functions are special types of closures
     
     Global functions are closures that have a name and do not capture any values
     
     Nested Functions are closures that have a name and can capture values from their enclosing function
     
     Closure Expressions are unnamed closures written in a lightweight syntax that can capture
     values from their surrounding context
