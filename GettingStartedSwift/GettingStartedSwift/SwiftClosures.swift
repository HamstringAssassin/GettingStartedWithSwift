    /**
    *  CLosures are self contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code. 
    Closures in swift are similar to blocks in C and objective-C
    
    Global and nested functions are special types of closures
    
    Global functions are closures that have a name and do not capture any values
    
    Nested Functions are closures that have a name and can capture values from their enclosing function
    
    Closure Expressions are unnamed closures written in a lightweight syntax that can capture
    values from their surrounding context
